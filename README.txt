This package contains the desired UI for the dashboard

chatgpt-google-dashboard will be the new version.

features:
1. Google Drive
2. Gmail
3. Google Calendar
4. Instead of a custom GPT that needs everything programmed by us, it will simply have a 
   button to connect to native (web) ChatGPT.
   a. Do not have to program logic, language processing, etc.
   b. NativeGPT has persistent memory on OpenAI servers (it can remember my lists and tasks)
***** c. **** this is the great work-around.  Since CGPT can work with and edit items in Google Drive,
*******  we will tell CGPT to update the lists/tasks and save them to Drive!! ***
      d. IF POSSIBLE, HAVE THE DASHBOARD DISPLAY THOSE DOCS- THEN IT CAN HAVE ANY DESIGN WE WANT!!!
